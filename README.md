# Physics Simulator
A physics simulator, with various modes to play around with. This project serves as a method for me to apply and revise my knowledge from IB Physics HL.

## Kinematics Mode
From my physics unit on kinematics in two dimensions, the mode simulates bouncing balls affected by everyday forces, neglecting air resistance.

* Click your mouse to spawn a ball
* To give it an initial velocity, when you click your mouse, drag it in a direction. The magnitude of your mouse displacement, alongside the angle will give the ball component vectors.
* Note: There are many bugs, such as the "infinite bounce" glitch which you will definitely notice. Well, that's now a feature!

## Compiling and Running
To see these simulations on your own, follow the following steps.
1. Download a Java SDK and add it to your system PATH
2. In your terminal or CMD, navigate to the directory in which you have downloaded this project.
3. Then run:
```
$ javac *.java
$ java Main
```
