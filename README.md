# Physics Simulator
A physics simulator, with various modes to play around with. This project serves as a method for me to apply and revise my knowledge from IB Physics HL.

## Kinematics Mode
From my physics unit on kinematics in two dimensions, the mode simulates bouncing balls affected by everyday forces, neglecting air resistance.
* click your mouse to spawn a ball
* to give it an initial velocity, when you click your mouse, drag it in a direction. The magnitude of your mouse displacement, alongside the angle will give the ball component vectors.
* Note: There are many bugs, such as the "infinite bounce" glitch which you will definitely notice. Well, that's now a feature!
